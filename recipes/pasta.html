        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A classic tomato sauce is made even better with a bit of cream and a delicious topping of burrata. The cherry tomatoes add a bit of sweetness to the sauce and make it feel fresher. It tastes too good to be as easy as it is, and thatâ€™s just what we want for a weeknight pasta dinner. </p>
