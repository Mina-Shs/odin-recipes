        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>1/2 cup pumpkin seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened protein powder</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chia seeds</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons flax seeds</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cacao nibs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup raisins</li>
            <li>8-10 Medjool dates</li>
            <li>1/3 cup keto chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1/2 cup creamy cashew butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Line an 8x8" baking dish with parchment paper and set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Combine all of the dry ingredients together in the bowl of a food processor until chopped up and mixed thoroughly. Set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>In a small saucepan, add coconut oil, nut butter and maple syrup. Heat on low and stir until the nut butter melts and the mixture looks pourable but still thick. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li><p>Transfer the dry mixture into a large bowl. Stir in the wet mixture and mix well until everything has been coated evenly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Transfer the mixture into the pan. Press down with the bottom of a glass cup or jar to pack it into the bottom of the pan to create an even base. You can top off the bars with some extra chocolate chips, pecans or unsweetened coconut flakes if you'd like!</p></li>
            <li><p>Place in the refrigerator to set overnight. Cut into 8 bars with a sharp knife and enjoy. These will keep in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.</p></li>
